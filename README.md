# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository is forked from https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning
No PRs are intended to be created from this repo to the original one; I have created this fork to add comments to the code to make it easier to understand the code.

The code is written for Python 2.6 or 2.7. Michal Daniel Dobrzanski
has a repository for Python 3
[here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35). MNielsen
will not be updating the current repository for Python 3
compatibility. I may update it though based on difficulties faced with running Python2 and Python3 on the same machine 
etc.

The program `src/network3.py` uses version 0.6 or 0.7 of the Theano
library.  It needs modification for compatibility with later versions
of the library.  MNielsen will not be making such modifications.

As the code is written to accompany the book, I don't intend to add
new features. However, if there are bugs found I may report them. 
Feel free to fork and modify the code.
